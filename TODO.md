## FUTURE UPDATES (maybe)
- [] Updated login page (includes email + password) or maybe sign in with Purdue if we can discuss the app w/ the university and come to some sort of agreement
- [] Automated conflict resolution system
- [] Messaging?
- [] IOS version
- [] Testing?

## PUBLISHING

- [] EULA
- [] Marketing? Is it to best to grow fast or slow? Is it better for the university to know about it sooner or later? I think sooner
- [] Talk with Purdue? It might be better to discuss and try to see the university's side and come to some sort of an agreement BEFORE publishing
