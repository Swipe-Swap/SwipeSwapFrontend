# SwipeSwapFrontend


# Inspiration

We got the idea for Swipe Swap when we realized that we were ending up with extra meal swipes each week and had nothing to do with them. So we created Swipe Swap with the goal of helping students save money and make money with their extra swipes.
What it does

# Core functionality:

- Sellers can list dining courts they are willing to swipe in and get food from, and their price for doing that.
- Buyers can buy swipes if they need an extra meal for cheap.

# How we built it

We build the frontend in Flutter and the backend using Firebase. We used Figma for UI mockups.

# Challenges we ran into

For the backend, our main challenge was learning how to use Firebase and integrating all the moving parts. We had a couple of cloud functions that updated certain tables based on other ones and that made things complicated.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

We got most of the pages for the front end working which was a huge accomplishment given the time constraint. We also got our cloud functions to work and we were able to implement the logic that matched the best available seller with a given buyer. This was a large undertaking but we were able to finish through debugging.

# What we learned

We learned how to use Firebase and Google Cloud Platform as well as how to integrate Firebase into a Flutter frontend using the Flutter API. We also learned how to use branches in git and resolve merge conflicts which was extremely useful when working on a complex project. We learned how to connect a full-stack application together.

# What's next for SwipeSwap

Smoothing out the edges as far as functionality. This includes some changes to the UI in Flutter and a few more cloud functions in the backend. Additionally we want to add support for iOS and non-mobile platforms. Our goal would be to launch the app and have it be usable for Purdue students.
